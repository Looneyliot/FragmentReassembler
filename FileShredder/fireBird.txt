The fire bird is identified again. Trees blow up in the forest where once their wings and throats were colors of forgiveness. The cottonwood outlining my window totters again. Every year, the fire bird scorches what you can't have. It is not his beauty that I regret. It is the cry to those that listen to the bird- "I burn them now. Someday, I will find you."
