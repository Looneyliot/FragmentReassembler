Al}{as, alas! how very s}{oon this silly little Fly, He}{aring his }{wily, flattering wo}{rds, came slowly flitting b}{y; With buzz}{ing wings she hung aloft,}{ then near and nearer dr}{ew, Thinking only of her }{brilliant eyes, and green and}{ purple hue- Thinking only o}{f her crested head-poor fooli}{sh thing! At last, Up j}{umped the cunning Spider}{, and fiercely held }{her fast. He drag}{ged her up hi}{s winding stair, into his dis}{mal den, Within his little }{parlour-but she ne'er}{ came out again}{! And now dear little childre}{n, who may thi}{s story rea}{d, To idle, silly flat}{tering words, I pray you n}{e'er give heed: Unt}{o an evil cou}{nsellor, close hear}{t and ear and eye, And take }{a lesson from this tale, of}{ the Spider and the Fly.  }{"Will you walk into my parlour}{?" said the Spider to the }{Fly, "'Tis the pr}{ettiest little par}{lour that ever you}{ did spy; The way into my pa}{rlour is up a }{winding stair, And I have man}{y curious things to shew when }{you are there}{." "Oh no, no,}{" said the little Fly}{, "to ask me is}{ in vain, }{ For who g}{oes up your winding sta}{ir can ne'er c}{ome down again." "I'm sure you}{ must be weary, dear, wi}{th soaring }{up so high; Will you rest up}{on my little bed?" said the }{Spider to t}{he Fly. "There are prett}{y curtains drawn around; the s}{heets are fine and thin, A}{nd if you like to rest awhil}{e, I'll snugly tuck you in!""}{Oh no, no," said the}{ little Fly, "for I've o}{ften heard it said, }{They never, never wake again,}{ who sleep upon your b}{ed!"  Said the cunni}{ng Spider t}{o the Fly, "Dear}{ friend what can I do, T}{o prove the w}{arm affection I}{'ve always felt for you? }{I have within my pantry, g}{ood store of all}{ that's nic}{e; I'm sure you're }{very welcome-will you pl}{ease to take a }{slice?" "Oh no, no,}{" said the lit}{tle Fly, "kind sir, that cann}{ot be, I've heard what's in y}{our pantry, and I do }{not wish to see}{!" "Sweet creature!" sa}{id the Spider, "you're}{ witty and you'r}{e wise, How handsome }{are your gau}{zy wings, how brilliant a}{re your ey}{es! I've a}{ little look}{ing-glass upon my}{ parlour shelf, If you'l}{l step in one m}{oment, dear, you }{shall behold your}{self." "I thank}{ you, gentle sir," she s}{aid, "for what you're pleased }{to say, And }{bidding you good morning n}{ow, I'll call another day}{."  The Spider turned}{ him round abo}{ut, and went int}{o his den, For well he}{ knew the sil}{ly Fly would soon come back}{ again: So he wove a su}{btle web, in a little cor}{ner sly, And s}{et his table ready, to dine u}{pon the Fly. Then }{he came out to his do}{or again, an}{d merrily did sing, "Come hi}{ther, hither, p}{retty Fly, with the}{ pearl and si}{lver wing; Your r}{obes are gree}{n and purple-there's }{a crest upo}{n your head; Your eyes are }{like the dia}{mond bright, but mine ar}{e dull as lead}{!" Alas, alas}{! how very s}{oon this silly little Fly,}{ Hearing his }{wily, flatteri}{ng words, came slowly flit}{ting by; With buzzing wings sh}{e hung aloft, then near}{ and nearer drew, Thinki}{ng only of her}{ brilliant eyes, and gr}{een and purple hue- Think}{ing only of her crest}{ed head-poor foolish thin}{g! At last, Up jumped the}{ cunning Spid}{er, and fiercely held her}{ fast. He }{dragged her up h}{is winding stair, i}{nto his dismal d}{en, Within}{ his little parlour-but}{ she ne'er ca}{me out again! And now d}{ear little children, wh}{o may this story read}{, To idle, silly fla}{ttering words, I pray yo}{u ne'er give heed:}{ Unto an evil counsellor}{, close heart and ear and}{ eye, And ta}{ke a lesson from}{ this tale, }{of the Spider and the Fly.  }
